Docker

All kind of docker files script and other related stuff.

A small note on running docker-compose, up and down are not complementary:
* docker-compose up, to start the application;
* docker-compose stop, to stop the application;
* docker-compose down, to stop and remove all images, data volumes, etc, etc.
